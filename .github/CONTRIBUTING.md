# Contributing

I love your input and I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

### How to contributing

- Fork it!
- Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
- Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
- Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
- Submit a pull request

## I Develop with Github

I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
